Explanation 1:
let C be the amount of packages that Quinn adds to a train.
Adding a package gives her $4 while loading a package costs her $1.
She only solely loses money when changing packages from train to train.
This will only happen when she has C packages on her train, which gave her 4C and cost her 1C
Then when switching over the packages to a new train, it'll cost 1C. So far her gain is 4C and loss is 2C.
She doesn't gain any money when removing packages and loses money when she has to downsize her train.
downsizing will only happen when there are C/4 packages. and it'll only cost C/4 packages to move everything to the new train.
In all of this, her total gain was 4C and total loss was 2C+C/4. 
Therefore no matter what she does the profit will always be greater than the loss.

Explanation 2:
- we are charged every 2^n packages 
- every time we upsize a car, we move 4x as many packages (per car), $4 lost (operating cost) per car
- therefore, since we only add cars when we increase exponentially, 
    the cost of adding cars will never surpass the revenue generated from loading packages 

The model prevents the loss of cars until absolutely necessary, which saves $4/train
